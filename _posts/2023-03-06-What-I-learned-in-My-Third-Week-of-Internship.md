Journal Week 3

##Day 9

Our mentor was unable to come to the office because he didn’t feel good. So he gave us a task thru slack, the task was to practice the tutorial provided by the Laravel website. The name of the tutorial was “Basic Task List”, we installed Php and composer to make the Laravel work. The tutorial was simple but I got stuck in certain instances because I was not that familiar with Laravel. We sought the help of sir Chris and he recommended us to ms. Grace. She helped us a lot we managed to unstuck ourselves, but I felt bad because we consumed a huge part of her time. 

##Day 10

We practiced Laravel even further and implemented the MVC structure. If I will give this day a title then this will be “ Patterns Patterns Patterns”,  I need to hone my skills in noticing pattern recognition skills. Sir tasked us to convert our routes into a controller. At first, the route codes are long and cluttery but once it was converted into a controller it was neat. It was certainly a good addition to my knowledge of Laravel

##Day 11

Our mentor make us delete our recent exercise and made another one and modify some parts of it. It was fun, and I manage to do my part. Sir then took us to a coffee shop to have a snack together with our senior Interns, we talked and laughed, It was a memorable day.

##Day 12

The task for this day is to fully modify the Basic Task List that we created in the previous days, I inserted some javascript and a little CSS in my project. But admittedly my work does not look that good. I enjoyed manipulating the task list and inserting some CSS and a little JS. It felt somewhat like therapy and seeing my project work feels good. 

This week is full of Laravel practice and familiarization, at first, it was somewhat confusing but after a few practices, I manage to use it smoothly. I appreciate our mentor for teaching us these lessons
