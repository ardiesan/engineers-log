This week, our main focus was all about testing, and our mentor introduced us to various tools that we could use, such as CODIUM AI, PHP UNIT, and PHP STAN. Additionally, we delved into AI image generation and used this tool to generate a background image for each of our weekly reflection entries.

## Twelfth Week Reflection:

### Day 1: PHPUnit and PHPStan

Today, our assigned task is to explore PHPUnit and PHPStan. Overall, these tools are quite useful for my capstone project. We have already finished developing our code, and we are now in the testing phase, conducting tests regularly. PHPUnit helps us with unit testing, ensuring that individual parts of our code work correctly, while PHPStan helps us maintain the overall quality and code maintainability. Thanks to PHPUnit, which automates test cases, our testing process has become more efficient and less troublesome. I am thankful for this improvement.

### Day 2: PHPUnit and Codium AI

Today, I continued my exploration of PHPUnit and attempted to integrate it with Codium AI's test case suggestions into my project. I learned that not all of the suggestions work; the majority of them have errors, which I still need to double-check and fix. This demonstrates that programmers will not easily be overtaken by AI.

### Day 3: AI Image Generation

Today, our assigned task is to explore an AI image generation website and create AI images related to the core topic of each of my reflections, inserting them into the corresponding markdown files. Most of these services are paid, but there are also free ones available, although there is a significant difference in quality. For learning purposes, I am using `getimg.ai`. It is proving to be a valuable learning experience. Experimenting with AI image generation not only enhances my understanding of this technology but also adds a creative dimension to my project.
