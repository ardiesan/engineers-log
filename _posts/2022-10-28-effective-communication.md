## Effective Communication

> My thoughts: "Communication VS Effective Communication"
        - Communication, by definition, is the exchange of information between two 
          or more people. To communicate is like second nature to us. We do 
          it on a daily basis, when we go to the supermarket, apply for work, or 
          even when playing with friends online. Although, expressing our thoughts and 
          feelings to others might seem fairly easy by just opening our mouths,
          this does not equate to effective communication. Remember that, mutual 
          effort and respect between two parties is vital in order to effectively communicate.
          One key indicator of effective communication is reciprocation. When the 
          second party delivers a response appropriate to the message (vice versa) 
          is a good sign that shows effective communication has been established.

> Factors that cause Communication Gap:
	-   Personality
	-   Focus
	-   No follow ups
	-   Knowledge
	-   Unpreparedness

> Communication Avenues
	-   Face-to-face
		-   Builds strong working relationships
		-   Thoughts and feelings are perceivable
		-   Engagement are easily shared
		-   Address sensitive issues
		-   Able to use all our senses
	-  Calls
		-   Senses - hear and see
		-   To communicate remotely
	-  Chat/DMs
		-   Almost Instant feedback
		-   Hard to address sensitive issues
	-  Email
		-   Only good for announcements and information sharing
		-   Not effective for back and forth discussions

> Mistakes or problems in communication
	-   Unpreparedness
		-   Did not Know, Think and didnâ€™t care
		-   Makes you vulnerable to mistakes.
	-   Assumption
		-   We are different people so we cannot assume everything in others.
		-   Always ask to confirm
	-   Interrupting
		-   Must practice to listen before sharing your thoughts.
		-   Make sure to allow the other party to finish his/her talk. 
                    This is also a way to show respect and good manners.
	-   Volume & tone of voice
		-   It is not what you say but how you say it, that creates the problem.
		-   The volume and tone of voice can influence or change a message's meaning. 
                    It also affects work relationship in an organization.
	-   Filler
		-   Shows how unprepared you are
		-   We all do this but we can stop this by pausing.
	-   In emails
		-   If too short then dm. If too long then just make a call.
		-   Not putting a subject title

> Effective Means
	-   Be professional
		-   As a professional, you should be able to do your best work
		-   Focus on the task at hand and ignore unrelated and unimportant things.
	-   Be prepared
		-   In order to be prepared, one must do some research other 
                    than assuming something.
		-   Ask what you do not know in order to be aware so that you can prepare
	-   Be confident
		-   PRACTICE TO BECOME CONFIDENT
		-   Accept correction or mistakes, with this we allow ourselves to change,
                     to get better.
	-   Be Visual
		-   Use any visualizing tools at your disposal to be able to convey effectively.
		-   This also shows that you are mindful of your audience. In this case you are 
                    being mindful to people who are visual learners.
		-   Visuals also helps demonstrate topics that involves data or numbers 
                    by presenting these data descriptively. Like charts.
	-   Be mindful
		-   Consider the face expressions, and body language of the 
                    people you talking to and vice versa.
		-   Effective communication is a two-way street. So you also 
                     have to be mindful of how you communicate to other. You have to 
                    consider the volume and tone of your voice, as well as your body 
                    language and facial expressions.
	-   Note Taking
		-   Apart from listening, taking notes is also helpful in effective 
                  communication because with this you are able to make or translate 
                    the information into your own enabling you to process/digest 
                    and remember the information.
	-   Be thorough
		-   When you have a note, you will be able to follow up, summarize, 
                    confirm and also validate an information.
	-   Be polite
		-   Politeness and a simple smile influences a person's impression of you. 
                   And when a person has a good impression of you. It creates this good 
                 atmosphere which at the end results to a healthy and harmonious work relationship.
		-   Another part of being polite, is  being accountable. 
                    If you have committed a mistake then apologize.
