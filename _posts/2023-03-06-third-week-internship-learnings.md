During the third week of my internship with the company, I gained a better understanding of the concept "laravel," including its definition, structure, and conventions. This week is primarily dedicated to practicing the laravel.

## The Ninth and Tenth Days

We were given the task of setting up a Laravel Docker, accessing the Laravel Docker, implementing the basic task list tutorial, and knowing the Laravel conventions, like patterns. I have gained some understanding of how to do Laravel using Visual Studio code and Docker.

### Knowing Laravel Conventions

- **Naming Controllers** - I learned that the name of a controller should be written in Pascal/Capital Case, with all the words written in the singular case, without any spaces between them, and ending with the word controller (e.g. TaskController).
- **Naming database** - I learned that this database should be created using lowercase letters, underscores to separate words, and the plural form.
- **Variables** - I learned that it needs to be lowercase with the initial character in camelCase.
- **Naming Conventions for Models** - I learned that a model needs to be written in PascalCase/CapitalCase. and every single word should be capitalized, without any spaces in between.
- **Blade view files** - I learned that words in blade files should be lowercase, snake case (e.g index.blade.php).

## The Eleventh and Twelfth Days

These days, I gained knowledge of the Laravel conventions, patterns, and migration so that it should be in the correct directory to migrate after modifying some files and not saved manually but rather migrated. By creating a simple task list that allows you to manually enter tasks using the add and remove functions while also displaying the tasks.

Finally, I gained knowledge about how to install Laravel Sail, access Laravel Docker, build a composer first project, use composer to implement the basic task lesson, understand certain conventions, and check the status of migrations. I'll do my best to practice Laravel more after I obtain some knowledge so that I may learn how to make it. I'll encounter certain problems, and if I can't fix it, I start over from scratch to help me remember the procedure. andÂ  I'm greatly grateful of our mentor's assistance in mentoring me and my fellow interns and for consistently encouraging us to adopt a more positive outlook.
