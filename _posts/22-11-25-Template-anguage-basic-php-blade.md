As the web got faster and better, the user started to want better-looking website designs that they can interact with. What makes a website great? how does this affect the user volume of your website? we already know that building a usable and functional website is hard especially if you are building it from scratch.

Back in the day web designing was only focused on the web itself, however, as the internet evolve we developers started to create new ways of building a functional website. Utilizing tools and frameworks that are meant to aid the hardships in developing a functional website. In this article, we will focus on the blade a simple yet powerful templating engine that was developed for PHP.


<br>

## Objectives
This article will focus on the following:
- What is blade?
- Advantages of using blade over other php frameworks
- Basic introduction on how can you use blade in your projects.


<br>

## Blade Introduction

<br>

### What is blade? 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jdayuday_blade_2.png" alt="picture 2" width="1500px">

<br>

The blade is a robust templating engine. Blade simplifies the use of the templating engine. Conditional statements and loops are provided by the blade templating engine. To make a blade template, you just create a file and save it with the.blade.php extension rather than the.php extension. The blade templates are kept in the directory /resources/view.

<br>

### Why blade is popular? 
Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade can integrate templates with a data model without increasing app complexity. It also provides developers with control structures such as conditional 'if' statements, loops, and comments. These are equivalents that are internally mapped to PHP.

<br>

## Blade for your projects
**You can use blade to handle the following:**

- Displaying data
- Blade directives
- Components
- Building layouts templates
- Rendering Blade fragment
- Forms
- Stacks
- Service Injection
- Rendering Inline Blade ts
- Extending Blade

These are the things you can do with the blade. However, since we are just getting started with a blade, let's keep it simple and easy for you.


<br>

## Let's try blade for the first time using Laravel framework

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jdayuday_blade_3.png" alt="picture 2" width="1500px">

<br>

Every blade file end with a must-have extension of `blade.php`. You can create your blade file in any directory you want,  but it's a best practice to place your `blade` under `resources/views` which most of your blades are located inside.


<span style="color:orange">Inside your blade file your try to input this simple Html tags</span>

```
<div>
    <center>
        <h1>Hello this is a sample blade file</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This is a sample demo on how to create and call a blade file in Laravel</p>
    </center>
</div>
```

### Calling your blade file using route

**To locate your route go to `routes` folder/ directory and open `web.php` in this file your can call directly call your blade file to display on your local webpage**

<br>

<span style="color:orange">Create a route for your blade file: </span>


```
Route::get('/sample', function () {
    return view('sample-blade');
});
```

if you can successfully, display the following blade commands on your local webpage that's awesome! 

It should look like this by:

<br>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jdayuday_blade_4.png" alt="picture 2" width="1500px">
 


<br>
<br>

### <span style="color:orange">Displaying data with blade</span>

Displaying data in you using your blade file, you can wrap your variable using curly brackets `{{ [variableName] }}`

Let's try this, in `web.php` you can edit your route to display a variable value inside your blade file. In your route name `sample-blade` you can add `,[variableName]=> 'variableValue'`  it should look like this:

```
Route::get('/sample-blade', function () {
    return view('sample-blade', ['petName' => 'Spike']);
});
```

for this example, we are going to display the called `petName` with the value of `Spike`.


Now let's edit your blade which we can call you variable `petName` to be displayed on your local webpage.

```
<div>
    <center>
        <h1>The name of my pet is : {{ $petName }}</h1>
        <p>She loves to eat her treats!</p>
    </center>
</div>
```

<br>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jdayuday_blade_5.png" alt="picture 2" width="1500px">


### When working with Javascript framework

Because many JavaScript frameworks utilize `"curly"` brackets to signal whether or not an expression should be shown in the browser, you may use the `@ symbol` to tell the Blade rendering engine that an expression should be ignored.

Sample: 

```
<h1>My petname</h1>
 
Hello, @{{ petName }}.
```

<br>

## Blade directives

In addition to data display, Blade includes handy shortcuts for standard PHP control structures like conditional statements and loops. These shortcuts allow you to interact with PHP control structures in a very clean while remaining concise and familiar to your PHP counterparts.

### if statements

Inside your blade file, you can perform a conditional statement by adding `@` in your conditional statement `@if, @elseif, @else, and @endif`.These directives function identically to their PHP counterparts. 

Reminder in using @if statements you need to end it with `@endif` to close your conditional statement.


<br>

### let's try code it

In your blade file `sample-blade` we will add conditional statements that you can try. This is what will gonna do, we will call our variable `petName` and if the value of `petName` is equal to the value we set in our statements it will prompt a message.

```
<div>
    <center>
        <h1>Guess the petname</h1>
        <h2>
            @if ($petName == 'Luna')
                your correct! 
            @else
                your wrong!
            @endif
        </h2>
    </center>
</div>

```


<br>

### Looping inside blade
Blade offers straightforward directives in addition to conditional statements for interacting with PHP's loop structures. When looping inside blade as I'be mentioned above each of your statements must have a closing statement.

**In blade looping you can perform the following looping statements:**

for loop:

```
@for ($i = 0; $i < [size]; $i++)
    This is number:  {{ $i }}
@endfor
```

<br>

foreach loop:

```
@foreach ($items as $item)
    <p>This is user {{ $item->id }}</p>
@endforeach
```

<br>

while loop:

```
@while (item != 0)
    <p>This is a number {{ $item }}</p>
@endwhile
```

<br>

When you are looping, you can use the @continue and @break statements. to continue the loop or stop it.

### Loop variable
The loop variable can be used, you are using for each loop inside of your loop, this variable can access the bits of information inside such as `index`, `first`, and `last`.
**$loop variable:**

```
@foreach ($items as $item)
    @if ($loop->first)
        This is the first iteration.
    @endif
 
    @if ($loop->last)
        This is the last iteration.
    @endif
 
    <p>This is user {{ $item->id }}</p>
@endforeach
```

<br>

### In addition, the $loop variable has a number of other helpful properties that you can use:

<br>


| Property              | Description                                               |
| --- | ----------- |
| $loop->index          | The index of the current loop iteration (starts at 0).    |
| $loop->iteration	    | The current loop iteration (starts at 1).                 |
| $loop->remaining	    | The iterations remaining in the loop.                     |
| $loop->count	        | The total number of items in the array being iterated.    |
| $loop->first	        | Whether this is the first iteration through the loop.     |
| $loop->last	        | Whether this is the last iteration through the loop.      |
| $loop->even	        | Whether this is an even iteration through the loop.       |
| $loop->odd	        | Whether this is an odd iteration through the loop.        |
| $loop->depth	        | The nesting level of the current loop.                    |
| $loop->parent	        | When in a nested loop, the parent's loop variable.        |

## Building layouts with blade

The majority of web applications have the same overall layout across all of their pages. If we had to duplicate the full layout HTML in each view we created, it would be tremendously time-consuming and difficult to maintain our program. We can thankfully define this layout as a single Blade component and use it throughout the rest of our application.

### Blade with bootstrap layout design for your front-end design

In this example let's create a design for our blade file `sample-blade`. Let's define a new blade file called `sample-design.blade.php`. This blade fill will hold all of our important bootstrap content for your blade design.

After you can create your blade file, let's open your `sample-design` file and importantly some bootstrap design for our front-end design.


```
<html>
<head>
    <title>[url-name] @yield('title')</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
    @yield('content')
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Let me explain what's happening in this example. In your blade-design file in your title tag, you will be able to change what is the name of your application gonna be, and we utilize `@yield` in which yield is used to define the content of your current blade file calling from the master page which is the `sample-design` file you created.

In your` head` tag we import a bootstrap of the bootstrap toolkit for their front-end design. which include `CSS and JavaScript`


To utilize your import let's edit your `sample-blade`. In your blade file. remove the content and replace it with the below:

<br>

```
<div>
    <center>

        <h1>Custest dog breeds in world!</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <table class="class">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">#</th>
                <th scope="col">First</th>
                <th scope="col">Last</th>
                <th scope="col">Handle</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">1</th>
                <td>Mark</td>
                <td>Otto</td>
                <td>@mdo</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">2</th>
                <td>Jacob</td>
                <td>Thornton</td>
                <td>@fat</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">3</th>
                <td colspan="2">Larry the Bird</td>
                <td>@twitter</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>


          <br>
          <br>

        <h1>Using a loop inside blade</h1>

        <br>
        <br>

        <table class="class">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Index</th>
                <th scope="col">Value</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                @for($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++)
              <tr>
                <td>{{ $i }}</td>
                <td>{{ $i + 1 }}</td>
              </tr>
                @endfor
            </tbody>
          </table>


    </center>
</div>
```

<br>

Let's run it in your local webpage, it should look like this:


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jdayuday_blade_7.png" alt="picture 2" width="1500px">

<br>

Now let's import the bootstrap layout we define earlier from our `sample-design.blade.php` file. To import that file we need to use `@extends` to use all the properties belonging to that blade file.

So add this code at the top of your `sample-blade` 

```
@extends('sample-design');
```

and in your table tag change the class to this following statement:

 
```
class="table table-striped"
```

or

```
table table-dark table-striped
```

It should look like this by now.

<br>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jdayuday_blade_7.png" alt="picture 2" width="1500px">


<br>

### Additionaly, here the other layout inheritance for blade directives that you can use.

<br>

| Blade directive       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| @extends      | specify which layout the child view should "inherit"       |
| @section   | Views which extend a Blade layout may inject content into the layout's sections        |
| @yield   | used to display the contents of a given section       |
| @section   | defines a section of content        |
| @parent   | master layouts or base layouts for views in your application, and typically, you will need to inherit those layouts from child views        |
