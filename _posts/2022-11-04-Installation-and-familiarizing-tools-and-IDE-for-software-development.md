The first week of my internship as a software engineer in fullspeed technologies. The overall experience on my first week was great and enjoyable, on that week me and my co-intern are tasked with different reading materials such as the topics on effective communication and the proper way the report a bug.

In the second week of my internship program, our mentor started giving us simple tasks and introducing us to the different software engineering tools, IDE, and communication software for our daily collaboration.

## Here some of the Tools, IDE and software that we used on that week:

* Slack - for daily communication for team members.
* **Git and Github** - project source control and managing different source code for a project.
* **VSCODE** - IDE for editing code.
* **Docker** and docker compose - used for creating and manage docker image file and containers.
* **command line** / terminal

All of these tools and IDE was installed using CLI (command line) here are the link for homebrew.
* **Slack** - brew install --cask slack
* **Git and Github** - brew install git
* **VSCODE** - brew install --cask visual-studio-code
* **Docker** and docker compose - brew install docker , brew install docker-compose

On the second week's task, were tasked to install and familiarize all the mentioned tools and IDE above. During the task execution, we slowly discussed the things we need to remember and practice on following standard procedures in taking, asking, and requesting a ticket review.

In the following days, we can accomplish tasks/tickets and tie things together on what exactly the goal of each task is and how can it be connected to the other tools that we are using. Lastly, at the end of the week are tasked to create an article on the learnings and tasks that we made. We are assigned also to make a pull request for the GitHub repository that is specifically for internship. The main goal of the task was not only to create an article out of our learning, the goal of the task if we can use the command line (CLI) for cloning, committing, and pushing changes from the GitHub repository.

## Here the homebrew command for each tools and IDE that you can use for command line:
* **MySQL** - `brew install mysql`
* **PhpStorm** - `brew install --cask phpstorm`

## Final day! It's weekly processing day
On the last day of our sprint, we are tasked to create another article and make a pull request out of it. It's a good thing I Already took the ticket on Installation of PhpStorm and familiarized it. Instead of using CLI. I did utilize the built-in terminal inside the IDE and practice how to clone a GitHub repository using PhpStorm GUI.

Additionally, I was planning to connect my MySQL docker container to MySQL workbench and PhpStorm. Lastly, we are advised by our mentor to signed our commit for git and github for security and protection.

This is the brew commands i did use during installatiion:
* **MySQL workbence** - `brew install --cask mysqlworkbench`
