Being selected as an intern at the company was a fortunate opportunity I was grateful for. I am eager to make the most of this opportunity to gain practical skills and insights into the IT industry.

## Reflection 1: Cathedral and the Bazaar

The article highlights the advantages of the Bazaar Model, which allows for faster development, quicker bug fixing, and a more adaptable software product. This is due to the power of community-driven collaboration. After reading the article, I can see why it has been a manifesto for the open-source movement. I think more developers and organizations should embrace these practices to better their software development. Community-driven collaboration can lead to such great results.

## Reflection 2: How to Report Bugs Effectively

Reporting bugs is crucial for the smooth development and improvement of the software. When encountering such bugs in software, taking the necessary steps to report them effectively is essential. This helps developers understand and fix the issue and improves overall software. Bugs can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, and security vulnerabilities, leading to user frustration and loss of trust. By addressing bugs promptly and effectively, developers can improve the user experience and maintain the reliability and integrity of their software.
