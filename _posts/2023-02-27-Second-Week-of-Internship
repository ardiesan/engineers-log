As days passed by, another week of my internship here at the company has been done. Several things happened, and it goes along with the learnings about software development and work ethics that I have gained. 

When working on a team project, one important consideration is the environment and tools that will be utilized throughout the process. It is crucial for the team to work with the same environment and tools to prevent any potential issues that could cause trouble for the project.

## WEEK 2
<hr>

### Day I : Git Commands
Activities:
- Understanding on how to pull, push, and commit using command-line interface (CLI).
- Understanding the concept of branching
- Understanding the proper way of making a git commit message.
- Understanding the purpose of rebase and how it was done.

Git is a powerful tool for managing software development projects, making it easier for teams to collaborate and keep track of changes to their code. It has some commands such as git pull, push, and commit.
1. **git push** - updates a remote repository with changes from your local repository.
    - git push
2. **git pull** - Retrieve changes from a remote repository and merge them into the active branch.
    - git pull
3. **git commit** - creates a fresh commit that contains the additions to the staging area..
    - git commit -m 'commit_message'

    Creating a commit message always follow a format. It must be:
    - Specific
    - informative
    - Concise

4. **git rebase**: is a Git command used to merge changes from one branch onto another branch
    - git rebase

### Day II : Business Ethics, Docker Desktop, and MySQL Workbench
Activities: 
- Understanding some business ethics that we must always take into account when working.
- Installation of Docker Desktop and MySQL Workbench 

Business ethics is concerned with fostering an atmosphere in which people and organizations can conduct themselves in a way that is ethically upright and accountable. Some of these responsibilities involves the following:
- Acknowledging work-related messages
- Setting time in checking emails
- Checking work-related notifications

Docker Desktop is a tool for creating and running apps in containers on your local computer. You can create, manage, and deploy Docker containers with the help of its user-friendly graphical interface and command-line tools.

For Docker Desktop installation using CLI in macOS, you can follow the steps below:
1. Search and open your terminal using the spotlight
2. In the terminal, type the text below for installation. (let's assume that you have homebrew in your local)
        - brew install --cask docker
3. Once done, Docker Desktop is now available in your local. Congratulations.

MySQL Workbench is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool used to create, build, and manage MySQL databases. Users may design, edit, and manage database schema, tables, and queries visually. 

For Installation in macOS, you can follow the steps provided below:
1. Search and open your terminal using the spotlight.
2. Assume that you have already homebrew in your local, in your terminal, type the text provided below:
        - brew install --cask mysqlworkbench
3. Once done, MySQL Workbench is now available on your local. Congratulations

### Day III : Docker Desktop, MySQL Workbench, and Docker Image
Activities:
- Still processing with Docker Desktop and MySQL Workbench 
- Creating a container from the docker image using docker desktop
- Create and delete database, table, and data

Docker Desktop is a GUI tool used to monitor docker images, and create a container out from a specific images such as MySQL image. The creation of a new container using a msql image will let you access its database via MySQL Workbench.

Docker image is a small, standalone, executable file that includes all of the components required to run a piece of software, such as code, libraries, runtime, system tools, and settings. It was created to operate within containers, which are independent, self-contained computing environments that may be used on any device or cloud platform that supports Docker.

For pulling MySQL image using a terminal in macOS, you can follow the steps provided below;
1. Search and open your terminal using your spotlight.
2. For pulling the image, type the text provided below in your terminal then enter. (You can check its official site for further information)
    - docker pull mysql
3. Once done, you can check your downloaded image using the Docker Desktop.
4. If you see the image in it, Congratulations you can now create your own MySQL container and database.

### Day IV : MySQL Workbench and Foreign Keys
Activities:
- Still understanding on how MySQL Workbench works.
- Understanding the concept of Foreign Keys

MySQL Workbench has its own way on how it works. It can create and delete database and table, and insert data. Tables can be connected into one using the Foreign Key. In order to link one table to the primary key to another, a relationship between the two tables must first be established via a foreign key. In a relational database, it is also a method of tying together similar data from different tables. Foreign key itself serves as the bridge that can connect between one table to another.

## Summary
Understanding the concept of a working environment and the tools to be utilized in making a project is one thing that we must take into account when working as a team. Additionally, understanding the functionality of the tools to be utilized is one way of making the job easier and faster. Furthermore, the usage of command-line interface commands using the terminal is a good practice in the field of software development.
