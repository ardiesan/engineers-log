This week was all about finding and fixing problems in the admin ticketing system. We worked together and solved some issues, and we learned that asking for help is okay. Let's dive into what happened this week.

## Day 1: Addressing System Inconsistencies and 5Ws and 1H in Communication 

#### Addressing System Inconsistencies
Today marked the beginning of the seventh week of my internship journey. Our manager tasked us with an assignment: to identify inconsistencies and issues within the admin ticketing system, which we had explored during the previous week. My task was to create a JIRA issue of type "Bug" centered around the inconsistency in filtering tickets by "Date Submitted." I observed that when attempting to set the "to" date as the present date, tickets requested for that same day did not appear in the search results. To overcome this, I proposed a solution, worked on the issue, and submitted a pull request. The solution involved adjusting the way dates were handled in the system, ensuring that tickets requested for the present date would be properly displayed in the search results.

#### Enhancing Communication: 5Ws and 1H
In addition to this technical challenge, our manager imparted a valuable lesson on effective communication using the concept of 5Ws and 1H: What, Why, When, Where, Who, and How. Embracing these principles enhances the clarity and informativeness of our messages, a crucial aspect in the precision-driven realm of software development.

#### Key Lessons Learned:
- Finding and fixing problems in a system is a big part of making sure everything works well.
- Utilizing the 5Ws and 1H method in communication enhances the clarity of messages, a super important skill in software development.

## Day 2: Document Signing and System Brainstorming

I didn't work on this particular day because there was something important to do. I went to the office to get some documents signed by our manager. These documents are needed for my practicum subject. I visited the office in the afternoon, waiting for my manager to arrive. However, I didn't have my laptop with me, so I didn't have much to do while waiting.

While I waited, I sat with one of my fellow intern, Jade. We decided to make the most of the time by exploring our admin ticketing system together. We talked about possible improvements we could make to enhance the system. It was a productive discussion and a great way to keep learning, even on a day when I didn't have any assigned tasks.

I learned that preparation is important, even if it's not directly related to coding and making good use of time, like discussing potential system enhancements, keeps the learning momentum going.

## Day 3: Finding System Issues

On this day, our manager assigned us a task - to look for more issues and inconsistencies in the admin ticketing system. We did just that and uncovered some more issues. I stumbled upon an issue: when you use the admin ticketing system and then shrink your browser window sideways, things get messy. The tables with information don't get a horizontal scroll bar, so you lose sight of what's on the right side of the table. It's a real hassle because it means you can't see everything you need to when you adjust your browser window. I handed this issue over to a fellow intern, and he fixed it.

Meanwhile, I was assigned with another issue. This one was about the profile section on the left sidebar. When you shrink the window horizontally, the profile section exceeds to the left navigation area. It was a bit of a puzzle to solve, so I reached out to my fellow interns for help. After a bit of brainstorming, I came up with a solution. I created a function and an event listener to check the screen's width. When the screen size changes, it triggers certain functions. It took me a to address this issue, but it reminded me that knowing when to ask for help is a big part of being a software developer.
