This week, we tackle Laravel Relationships, especially the one-to-many relationships. At first, the days are rough, but later on, it gets better.

## Laravel Relationship
On this day, we were tasked to integrate the one-to-many relationship into our task list. It was quite a challenge for me because I do not know where to start. Throughout the whole day, it was a challenge because we did not think about starting over again, we tried to improve our task lists just the way as it is. We got stumped on what to do next and on my end, I felt bad about it.

## Back to Square One
This day, we continued to configure our task list, but with the help of our mentor. We reset everything we've made to the point we generated the basic of the basic task list. Resetting made it so much better because we can configure the functionalities, not the cosmetics, as our mentor had told us on this day. On this day, we were also taught how and what thinking process should we follow, then managed to come up with the solution and fix certain anomalies in the application. I gained a significant amount of knowledge just by observing what our mentor has done.

## Individual Tickets
On this day, this is the first time we had individual tickets to work on our generated Basic Task List. Each of us are assigned with different tickets or in simple terms, tasks. I was tasked to follow the previous dayâ€™s finished work and then let everyone pull the repository that I made so that it serves as the main project. In this session, I had a lot of fun because we can focus on our specific tasks.

## Consistency is Key
24 days inside the company, we then continued to improve our work. To make sure that the developed web application is neat, we must make sure that everything should be as consistent as possible when delivering results. We continued to modify our task list and got it verified by our mentor. We had many issues with the structure of the things and also on routing, then our mentor gave us tips and pointed us to where we got something wrong.
