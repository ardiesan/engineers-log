Its now been three weeks since my onboarding. My body clock is now adjusted to waking up early, and to sleeping early as well. Too early perhaps.

## Wednesday (Aug 30, 23): Stop Bugging Me (2)
---

I was tasked, on that day, to use Jira, an enterprise software used for issue tracking. It would be the first time I'd be using the software properly and not just by playing and looking around. I made my tickets and added them to the backlog and when I saw the board, it was a familiar sight because I have already used Trello, which is also a software that tracks tasks and workflow. 

I believe this would be an experience akin to driving a car, which is that it would be exciting at first because its a new experience but then as I gradually get used to it, it would be just a normal task. Like how I got my driver's license, I was excited to drive around but now, it's just a regular task.

While working using Jira, I come to imagine that this was how people in the industry would do to, create an issue/ticket, give at a certain story point score, assign it to someone. This gave me a feel that I was also part of the industry, albeit me and the interns are just working on an isolated project.

## Friday (Sept 1, 23): Stop bugging me (3)

What I would be doing on this day would be a continuation of what I did the past work day. During the past few days, I have been figuring out in my head how I would solve any of the bugs not only that I have reported but also the bugs that I found but didn't get to report because there were just too many. That way, when I get back to work on the next day, I can solve the issue immediately. 

My fellow interns and I were still finding and also discussing the bugs we reported to each other to see if these are actual bugs and what not. We had a nice environment to collabrate in since we were right beside each other and it was even better that each of us were able to contribute in each others own work. I hope that such cooperation would continue to cultivate between us interns and eventually to our future co-workers by the time we fully integrate ourselves in the industry.
