I dedicated Day 1 to refining my Jekyll project's UI and securing GitHub workflows by creating a table of contents and safeguarding sensitive information. On Day 2, I successfully modified workflow files, ensuring data security, and added a Read Time plugin. Day 3 involves ongoing UI enhancements, exploring plugins, and initiating preparations for my final internship article.

## Nineteenth Week Reflection:

### Day 1: Enhancing Jekyll UI and Securing GitHub Workflows

Today, my main focus is to improve the user interface of my Jekyll project, so I have created a table of contents for my reflections. Our mentor also reminded us to review our GitHub workflows and ensure that important information is not publicly accessible, emphasizing the need to store it as a secret variable.

### Day 2:  Simplifying My Jekyll Project with a Fresh Theme

Today, I successfully modified my workflow YAML files, storing all the important information as a secret variable, and everything is working fine. Additionally, I have added a Read Time plugin to my Jekyll application.

### Day 3:  Exploring plugins

Today, my task is to continue working on my Jekyll Project by making improvements to the user interface and exploring various plugins and packages. Simultaneously, I am also going to start preparing my final article, which will detail my experience during the internship.
