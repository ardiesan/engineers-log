Over the span of three days, I delved into GitHub Version Tagging, comprehending its significance as a snapshot of a project at a specific point. 

## Nineteenth Week Reflection:

### Day 1: Enhancing Jekyll UI and Securing GitHub Workflows

Today, my main focus is to improve the user interface of my Jekyll Porjecty, so I have created a table of contents for my reflections. Our mentor also reminded us to review our GitHub workflows and ensure that important information is not publicly accessible, emphasizing the need to store it as a secret variable.

### Day 2:  Simplifying My Jekyll Project with a Fresh Theme

Today, I successfully modified my workflow YAML files, storing all the important information as a secret variable, and everything is working fine. Additionally, I have added a Read Time plugin to my Jekyll application.

### Day 3:  Exploring plugins

Today, my task is to continue working on my Jekyll Project by making improvements to the user interface and exploring various plugins and packages. Simultaneously, I am also going to start preparing my final article, which will detail my experience during the internship.
