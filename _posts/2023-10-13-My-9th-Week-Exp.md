My previous task, which I completed on my previous workday, was to make a bash script that will make a backup of my web application and format it to a .tgz format and then I made a cronjob that would run that that script weekly. My new task would be a extension of that. What I will be required to do is for the backup on the server also be available on my local device.

I spent my time rattling my brain on how to make it work. I was figuring out how I can let the server send the backup to the local device. After some time has passed, with the guidance of my manager, I changed perspectives, rather than the server sending the data to my local device, why don't I let my local device fetch the data from the server. I then implemented that functionality and it was a success.

I spent the other half of the day researching on CICD (Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment). It is a very useful practice which combines other practices continuous integration and continuous delivery or, less often, continuous deployment. Although I currently have no projects that may benefit from the implementation of this practice, I know that in the future, when I become a more skilled developer, with numerous projects on my belt, I have CI/CD as a tool for me to use to better streamline my workflows.

Nothing much happened today, it was a continuation of what I did yesterday, which was to research on CICD. I also researched on Github Workflows and Actions, which is an automated CICD platform that creates seamless, versatile CI/CD pipelines in Github. I also spent my downtime improving my knowledge and skills by checking out and practicing with other technologies such as SASS, Vue, and React.

Here I was tasked to read on reverse SSH and what a Poor Man's VPN is. SSH is direct secure connection to another computer so the you can control it while reverse SSH, also known as Reverse SSH tunneling or remote port forwarding, the remote system connects with your local system.

On the later half of the day we review on what the HTML DOM is. The other fellow interns were unfamiliar with the topic and perhaps also forgot about it, while I can still recall the concept when I was first introduced to in when I was in my 9th Grade. Since I was more familiar with the topic, I was tasked to give my fellow interns a rundown on what the HTML DOM is. This gave a small experience in what it is to be if I were the tech lead in a companies project. What I would be doing is to first introduce myself to the technology of whatever the project will be using and understand it to help guide the developers that I am leading.

Basically, in layman's terms, the HTML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. It presents an HTML document as a tree-structure. And the way we accessing and manipulate these documents is with JavaScript.

The rest of the day was spent on review the HTML DOM and the ways to access the elements within the document as well as introduce myself to XML which is an requisite to know when I introduce myself to AJAX in the future
