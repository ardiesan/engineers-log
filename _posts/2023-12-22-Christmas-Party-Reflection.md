## A Night of Surprises and Fun

Attending my first company Christmas party was super fun and special. I was a bit unsure at first, but it turned out to be a night full of cool things that made it unforgettable. I went with my fellow interns, and even though our manager couldn't make it, we decided to enjoy the party together. The place was amazing, and the food was really good. It showed how much the company cares about making its employees happy. While we were at our table, we got to meet another employee who joined us. He was friendly and introduced himself, and we did the same. It was nice to make a new work friend in such a relaxed setting. There was this raffle thing where they picked names for prizes. I didn't win anything, but that was okay. What made it awesome was seeing someone else win and being so happy about it. The prizes were cool, like stuff you'd want to have. Then, they gave out awards to some employees. Some had been working for the company for five years, and others got special awards for being outstanding. It got me thinking about how cool it would be to get one of those awards in the future. At the end of the party, they gave us a gift to take home. It was a nice way to wrap up the night. I left feeling happy and excited, looking forward to more moments like these in the future.

## Heartwarming Gifts and New Connections

One of the most heartwarming moments of the evening was receiving a thoughtful gift from one of my fellow interns. As we gathered around to exchange presents, I unwrapped a neatly wrapped gift to discover a stylish cap inside. The gesture was particularly touching because my fellow intern had noticed my habit of wearing caps daily. The choice of a cap as a gift showcased a level of attentiveness and consideration that went beyond the typical exchange. It wasn't just a random item, it was a personalized token of appreciation that reflected an understanding of my preferences and daily habits. In that simple yet meaningful act, my fellow intern demonstrated a genuine effort to make the gift both personal and practical.

## Bridging Cultures: Greetings with Japanese Managers and CEO

In addition to the delightful gift exchange, the evening was marked by a unique opportunity to interact with the Japanese managers and the CEO. As we entered the venue, we had the chance to greet them, adding a special touch to the event. The atmosphere during the party was contagious, and it was evident that all attendees, regardless of their cultural background, were having a great time. What stood out the most was the harmonious blending of Japanese and Filipino colleagues, transcending cultural differences and fostering a sense of unity. It was heartening to witness how everyone, regardless of race, came together seamlessly, creating a truly inclusive and enjoyable celebration. At that moment, the boundaries of nationality seemed to disappear, highlighting the company's commitment to fostering a diverse and harmonious work environment.

## Exceeding Expectations: Joy and Connection

My first company Christmas party exceeded my expectations, turning what could have been a hesitant evening into one filled with joy and connection. The spontaneous gift exchange, interactions with colleagues, and unexpected encounters with the managers and the CEO made the event truly unforgettable. Despite our manager's absence, the experience showcased the warmth and inclusivity within the company, leaving me eagerly anticipating future celebrations.
