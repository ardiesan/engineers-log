The internet is a common communication tool in today's society since it allows us to keep up with information that is published on social media, in the news, in business, in education, and on the state of the economy. Web development plays an important position in society by assisting those who are running businesses to sell online. It also helps students learn more about web development.

## Web Development

I learned that the term "web" refers to the websites we see on the internet, such as Facebook, Instagram, and others. "Development" refers to the process of starting from scratch to create an application. Creating websites is making an application having a front end and back end that is used to store some data and maintaining websites for performance and security. I gained some basic understanding in front end, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

In my journey in web development, when I start making or encountering a web application, I don't have the knowledge or any skills. Even at first, when I look at the HTML code, it puzzles me as to how to understand it, but I try to apply and understand the code, and it turns out the way I expected. Even if it's hard the first time, I know how to understand some patterns in coding. But now that I'm doing my internship and we're focusing on web development, I have a hard time understanding, but even if I don't have the skill, as long as I can understand what I'm doing with my codes, it will turn out well. During my internship, I can write a web application for practice, understanding the codes of how to make an application with the guidance of our mentor. I'm so very grateful that our mentor really helps me a lot, even though I can't accomplish my task on time.

### Skills

Here's the skills I learned during the internship.

- **Time Management** - `organize time and able to deliver the task on time.`
- **Communication** - `speak in a smart way and it should always verify when have a doubt in doing some task`
- **Critical Thinking** - `ability to analyze and fix the problem in doing some task`
- **Coding Languages** - `learning some coding in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript`
- **Git** - `learning how to make a commit, add a branch, add a file, switch a branch, delete a file`

Lastly, I'm so grateful to have my internship at the company because I am able to understand the concept of web development and how to create and build it from scratch. Even though I don't have a skill, I was able to understand the basics of coding, and I will always remember to check the pattern so that after I finish my internship, I can nurture the knowledge I gained during the internship.
