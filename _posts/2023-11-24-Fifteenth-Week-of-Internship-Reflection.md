Over the past three days, I've immersed myself in customizing and refining my Jekyll project. The first day was an exploration of the theme, understanding its components like layouts and liquid templating. Challenges arose but served as valuable lessons, boosting my confidence in steering and enhancing the project. Day two focused on the creative process of tweaking layouts and liquid templating, turning obstacles into opportunities for improvement. On the third day, I successfully deployed the project locally and integrated weekly reflection markdown files. The overall experience has been rewarding, providing insights into Jekyll project creation and deployment.

## Fifteenth Week Reflection:

### Day 1: Exploring and Customizing My Jekyll Project

Today, I delved more into my Jekyll project's theme and found it's like a well-organized toolbox. The different parts, such as layouts and liquid templating, make it easy to shape how my project looks. It's like having Lego blocks to customize without the hassle. I faced some challenges, but they turned out to be helpful lessons, making me more confident in steering and improving my Jekyll project. It's exciting to see how tweaking these elements can give my project a unique touch. Also, I realized how easy it is to make a blog page nowadays. I am grateful for this.

### Day 2:  Tweaking and Improving My Jekyll Project

Today, my task is to redesign my Jekyll project, diving into the creative process with a focus on tweaking various elements like layouts and liquid templating. As I address challenges along the way, each adjustment feels like a step forward, turning stumbling blocks into opportunities for improvement.


### Day 3: Deploying my Jekyll Project with GitHub Pages

In reflecting on the tasks from last week and these few days, I successfully deployed my project locally. This achievement enabled me to configure, redesign, and integrate all of my weekly reflection markdown files into my personal Jekyll project. As for today's task, the objective was to deploy it via GitHub Pages.

Today, I learned that not all Gemfile plugins are supported when deploying through GitHub Pages. I encountered an issue where I couldn't view my markdown entries on the main page, attributed to the lack of support for the `gem 'jekyll-archives'`. I have also configured a GitHub workflow for this project that enables auto-deployment whenever there are changes. Despite this challenge, the experience of creating and deploying a Jekyll project has been enriching, and I am grateful for the learning opportunity.
