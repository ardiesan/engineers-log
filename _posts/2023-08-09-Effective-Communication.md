In my recent experiences, I've discovered the power of clear communication. One particular instance showed how assumptions can lead to misunderstandings. This reflection looks into how lack of proper communication can affect outcomes and emphasizes the importance of being clear in our interactions.

My mistake was not discussing the task properly with my senior. Instead of confirming the specifications, I relied on my assumptions and completed the task according to my own understanding. This led to misunderstanding and a different outcome. I learned that effective communication is crucial to avoid misunderstandings and mistakes. It's important to set clear expectations and verify specifications before proceeding with a task. Relying only on assumptions can lead to mistakes and errors. I now understand the significance of active listening, verifying information, and maintaining open communication with my senior.

In the video about effective communication, I learned important things for better talking and understanding. Communication needs expectations or plans. It helps work and relationships. A good communicator listens, speaks clearly, and respects others. If I want to be better at talking, I should learn how to listen.

Face-to-face talking is best for addressing problems and issues. It helps share feelings and thoughts.

In software development, good communication is very important. Bad talking can make mistakes happen, like when a client tells one person, but that person doesn't tell the right person. This can make the product not right for the client.

To fix talking problems:

- Think and be ready.
- Assumptions are okay if we check with the team.
- Donâ€™t talk when others talk. Listen more.
- Good talking makes us confident.
- Being ready stops using extra words.

Effective communication also means being professional, ready, and confident.  Progress is good, and being corrected helps us learn. Confidence comes from practice and learning. Being clear, careful, and polite is important too.

So, I will work on being a better communicator in my work and learn from my mistakes.
