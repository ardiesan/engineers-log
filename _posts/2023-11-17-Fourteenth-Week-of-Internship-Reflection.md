This week, our primary focus is on understanding static and dynamic sites and gaining hands-on experience with a Jekyll project. Reflecting on the events of the past few weeks in my internship, I am struck by the depth and breadth of knowledge I have acquired. Each week has brought forth new challenges and learning opportunities, and I appreciate the chance to further develop my skills.

## Fourteenth Week Reflection:

### Day 1: Understanding Static and Dynamic Sites

Today, our task is to study static and dynamic sites.

So, what are they?

Thinking about static and dynamic websites is like choosing between simplicity and interactivity. Static websites have fixed content that doesn't change much, making them straightforward and quick. They work well for smaller projects with less frequently updated content.

On the flip side, dynamic websites are more interactive. They create content on the spot, adjusting based on what users do. This makes them great for larger projects that need personalized experiences, real-time updates, and features like user authentication or content management systems.

As I learn about web development, grasping these differences helps me see the variety of options available. It's about finding the right balance between simplicity and interactivity, depending on what a website or application needs. This reflection deepens my understanding of the many tools and strategies in the world of web development.

### Day 2: Setting up a Jekyll project

Our mentor assigned us a task: to find static site generators, with a primary focus on markdown, and deploy them either locally or using GitHub Pages. I discovered some Jekyll themes on the website `https://jekyllthemes.io/free`. Initially, it was challenging to find suitable themes because most of them had outdated packages on the provided website, and I encountered many errors along the process. Consequently, it took some time to rectify these issues before I could deploy the site locally. However, I successfully set up my Jekyll project, and the accomplishment was quite satisfying. By the end of the day, I realized how easy it is to create a blog page using Jekyll. I'm grateful for this newfound knowledge and am confident I can apply it in the future.

### Day 3: Exploring and Redesigning my Jekyll project 

After setting up my Jekyll project from the previous workday, my current task is to explore the application, try to understand and experiment with the codes and redesign the UI.
