The second week was quite amazing to learn a lot.

##Day 5 (February 20, 2023)

On day 5 at the company, we learned to add authors, make a markdown file with our articles in it, and push it via the VSCode terminal to the main branch in GitHub. We first made another clone so that no problem will emerge. Also, I have learned that when committing, I must put a specific commit message for the viewer to grasp what I am currently doing.

##Day 6 (February 21, 2023)

On day 6 in the company, I learned things the hard way about going to conference rooms without asking permission and not attending or checking the Slack app often for messages. I will consider this to ensure I do not make any other mistakes.

I have learned these:

- Laravel,
- MVC,
- HTTPS, and
- DOMs.

It was quite a challenge for me to understand these quickly.

##Day 7 (February 22, 2023)

Day 7 in the company and we were introduced to Docker Desktop and MySQL Workbench. I practiced generating the images for MySQL and making containers in the Docket Desktop and linking them to the MySQL Workbench by using the manual and the CLI method and then running them. I then practiced making basic tables.

##Day 8 (February 23, 2023)

Day 8 in the company, and we continued to refine our skills in creating tables in the MySQL workbench. Our mentor taught us about foreign keys and how to link a column from one table to another. I slowly learned about foreign keys and the JOIN command, which is used to merge multiple tables, and it was quite fun.
