On the third of our internship in the company, we are heavily using the Laravel framework. Let's dive in.

##Day 9 (February 27, 2023)

On the 9th day inside the company, I sighed in relief, indicating that I had made significant progress with using the MySQL Workbench and the Docker Desktop in creating tables. These tools may seem very scary for me, but with enough practice, dedication, and time poured in using these, I will eventually learn to use it properly.

During this time we were tasked to set up the Laravel Docker, access it and then implement the tutorial given by our mentor which is a basic task list of sorts. We did manage to install it but had difficulties with the tutorial.

##Day 10 (February 28, 2023)

The next day, we continue to work on our outputs and got educated by our mentor about the problems that we encountered the past day. On this day, the one major lesson I got was that we should always recognize patterns and also be able to indicate whether we are in the right context. We got stuck because our task lists aren't generating, and we finally managed to debug it and proceed with our tasks with the help of our mentor.

##Day 11 (March 1, 2023)

On Day 11, we made our projects using the steps provided by our mentor in generating a new Laravel project, then push it to our personal GitHub accounts so that we can have a file we can practice on. I now remembered the tasks in order so that there are no complications when making another project.

##Day 12 (March 2, 2023)

Day 12 in the company and we were tasked to improve our basic task list site at the localhost. I made some changes to how it looks and how it functions and all in all I had fun generating my own task list form. I made some CSS, provided an extra column for the table, and inserted a prompt for the confirmation of the deletion of a task. I was having fun during the day because of the task given.
