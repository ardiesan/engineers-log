# Internship learning in fullspeed technolgies	

Here are some of the things that I've done as a software engineer intern at FULLSPEED TECHNOLOGIES INC. On my first initial week at FULLSPEED, I started my day with a virtual meeting with one of the admins for social media specialists, in this meeting I had learn about the company's background in software consultations, Digital marketing, and offshore development.

In the following topic, I was able to know the organizational structure of the company and its mission and its vision. At FULLSPEED at end of every month, the company has a monthly knowledge sharing in which employees can share their knowledge with the team. During this time I was invited to another meeting for the introduction to the team/department to that I will belong (Titan department). The Titan department is one of the development departments in the company. In this particular virtual, we talk about the department goals which are :

-   Project delivery
-   Productivity
-   Quality

Have you noticed that these three goals are not being numbered/ordered? in the department goals these three goals are treated as equal while the focus of the Titan department core values is: 

-   Trust and Respect
-   Teamwork
-   Accountability
-   Professionalism

In the coming days, we are assigned different readings regarding effective communication, correctly asking a question, and effective debugging. An effective way of communication was the first thing that we need to work on during the first week of my internship this topic it's talking about the different means of effective communication such as :

-   Be professional
-   Be prepared
-   Be confident
-   Be visual
-   Be mindful

The focus on this area is how will you be able to effectively communicate, as humans we should realize that people have different ways of looking into things, and it is important to apply these methods when you're communicating with other people.

The next reading I had was about how to ask good questions and report a bug. in the first reading, I was able to learn different things that are crucial in software development, and asking a question in general the article focuses on the way how you should smartly ask a question and be able to consider the following things that you need to do before asking the question these are: 

1.  Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
2.  Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
3.  Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
4.  Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
5.  Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
6.  Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
7.  If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

as mentioned above, you need to do those things first Before asking a technical question by e-mail, in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, it is important to consider which forum you will be posting/asking your question.

Lastly, last week we were assigned to do the readings regarding how to report a bug effectively in this reading I learned some important things to consider when reporting a bug. It is very important when you encounter a bug, it should be documented and detailed for the programmer/developers to make it fail again. Additionally, the user needs to be calm when bugs occur, it is important to stop and calm
