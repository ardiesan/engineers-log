Looking back, it is getting closer to two months since I have started to my internship here. It has been a very fruitfly experience so far although I may be biased since this is the path that I took, but I don't think I would be able to do this much if I applied to any other company. I have gotten a lot of insight of what it means to being working in this globalized industry. Heres a summarization of what my experiences are so far.

# Effective Communication

Effective communication is vital to ensuring everything goes smoothly. In reporting bugs, it necessary to make sure that the other party understands what you are talking about and make sure the you are both on the same page. There may be issues in communications, these issues could be the result of there not being enough clarity on stating what to problem is, and even perhaps there is no mention on how to reproduce the bug that is being issued. Maybe there is no clear guideline on how to fix the problem that is being talked about.

To solve this gap in communication, one would have to put themselves in the perspective of the other person, would they be able to understand what you are saying, with zero context? No matter how redudant it maybe, make sure that you can drive the point across, in order to promote a more harmonious work environment.

# Friendship Branch

Usually, when working on a project, each person would be working on their own task and feature, so that means that they will be working on an isolated branch with no interferance with another branch in order to prevent complications such as affecting each others code. But what if the feature is a task to big for a single person to handle? Then it would require more people to work on the said feature. This would mean that the users assigned to that task would have to be on the same branch. This scenario was the basis of the exercise that me and my fellow interns have done. Our task was to work on a single file in which we would make an article on a topic we all agreed upon. We then understand what happens if the file we have in our own system is not up to date with the file that has been pushed to the branch. As well as how we were able to avoid messing up each others inputs

# Stop Bugging Me

My fellow interns and I were tasked to locate, identify, and report the bugs we find in a project, as well as make a proposal on how to solve the issue. There were numerous visual bugs that we noticed as we had noticed and the next step we had to do was report them through a ticket in Jira. In the ticket, we were required to thoroughly describe the bug, enumerate the steps on how to reproduce the bug, as well as suggest a proposal on how to resolve the issue.

This is also acts as an application of my previous reflection, about effective communication. Although it may be a process that one, who has just been introduced to it, see it as time-consuming. I reflected on that aspect and come to realize that bug reporting is a necessary step in the process to ensure the we adhere to the conventions and standards of this industry.

# Public Key Infrastructure

__**Public Key Infrastructure**__ (PKI) or Public-Private Key pairs. It is a system that...... and the Secure Shell (SSH) utilizes this concept. (talk about what public and private keys do). This is for increased security  as it prevents unauthorized users from accessing.

We did a short exercise on how to SSH to a website via the macbook. Afterwards was the real challenge, what we had to do do was to SSH from our macbook into our phones and then, from our phones, we would SSH to the same website mentioned before. It proved to be a real challenge because we didn't know how place our public keys in the system we SSH'ed into. After a gruelling 4 hours, we succeeded in the task and we no longer needed to include our private keys and had no prompt to input the password since our device is recognized through the public key we added to the authorized keys of the system.

# Into the Live(wire)light

__**Livewire**__ is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple. It renders the initial component output with the page (like a Blade include). When an interaction occurs, Livewire makes an AJAX request to the server with the updated data. This would result only the component to be re-rendered.

The others and I were tasked in doing research on Livewire, which is a framework that was promoted to be easir and less complicated to other similar frameworks such as Vue and React. I started a new project and followed the documentation on how to make a component, along with watching a few tutorials that explored the functionalities of Livewire and its utilizations. Though I aim to do more complex projects in the future to further improve my understanding of its features, but aside from that, it would also help me on Laravel as a whole and not only on singular components. I would like to make a whole project from scratch, from making migrations, controllers, and views to handling routes and such.
