This week was a bit odd with so many days off due to holidays, leaving just one workday, Wednesday. On that day, I struggled a bit to get our local Engineer's Log set up. But when work slowed, I didn't stop. I kept poking around with my Laravel app, trying out new things. Adding a new feature became a highlight. Seeing my code do something, no matter how small, always brings a smile.

## Balancing Learning and Rest

This week was full of holidays, leaving just Wednesday for work. My main task was to get our local version of Engineer's Log up and running. During our meeting, our manager guided us through the process, but despite following the instructions, I couldn't get it to work initially. After the meeting, I did some research, and eventually, I managed to sort it out and made it run on my machine. In the Engineer's Log, I saw that my AI-generated images were already embedded in each reflection. To be extra sure, I went through each entry to verify that the image paths were correct.

Amid the more free time due to the holidays, I didn't pause my efforts in developing my Laravel app. I believe in keeping the momentum going and learning something new every day. So, I decided to integrate NewsData.io's API into my app, filtering it to bring in technology-related news. The news is displayed in my Laravel app. Additionally, I set up an Artisan command to fetch the news and refresh the 'news' table in my database. I plan to execute this command every couple of days through cron jobs on the server, refreshing the database with the latest news. I find joy in this process, it's thrilling to see my code functioning, no matter how simple it is. Overall, it was a fulfilling and productive week.
