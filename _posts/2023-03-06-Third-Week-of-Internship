Another week at the company has begun, and we have added to our knowledge of software development. Our task is to install additional software that will be utilized in the process and to apply the basic tutorial for Laravel. My specific task for myself this week is to observe, apply, and understand the concepts of Laravel in order to fully comprehend it.

## WEEK 3
<hr>

### Day I
Activities:
- Setting up laravel in my local machine
- Accessing laravel in my local machine
- Implementation of the basic tasklist tutorial

In the third week of my first day at the company, we began by properly installing additional software to be used in the development process. Using Homebrew made the installation quick and easy. Laravel is an open-source, PHP-based web framework that provides developers with tools and features to create web applications quickly. To utilize Laravel, we needed to install other software such as PHP and Composer. To install them using Homebrew, follow the steps below:

* For PHP::
1. Open your terminal using your spotlight
2. In your terminal, input the following command <br>
        $brew install php
3. After installation, your PHP is now present on your local machine. Congratulations


* For composer:
1. Open your terminal using your spotlight
2. In your terminal, input the following command <br>
        $brew install composer
3. After installation, your composer is now present on your local machine. Congratulations.

In addition to that, PHP is one of the most well-known tools for creating dynamic websites. It has many features that make it easy and effective to use. Composer, on the other hand, is a PHP-based tool that manages PHP Artisan commands, making tasks such as creating, deleting, and more, easy to execute using your terminal.

### Day II
Activities:
- Still continuing the basic laravel tasklist tutorial

On the next day, we implemented the basic tutorial for Laravel's task list. The tutorial taught us how to create a simple task list using Laravel. However, we encountered a blocker during the migration portion, where the created container needed to be connected to its main file in order to make it functional. Nonetheless, we were able to create additional files using PHP Artisan commands, such as controller and migration files. Additionally, we learned about the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept, where the Model handles the website's database, the View provides the expected reaction from user actions, and the Controller manipulates everything and serves as the bridge from the user to the website. These were the key takeaways from my second day at the company.

### Day III
Activities:
- Understanding the laravel convention
- Understanding the concept of migration and controller

On the third day of my internship at the company, I continued to work on understanding the basic tutorial for creating a task list using Laravel. I encountered various topics such as migration, routes, and controllers during the activity. PHP Artisan commands were helpful in creating the necessary files quickly and easily. Some of the commands I used are listed below:
- php artisan make: migration - helps me in creating a migration file
- php artisan make: model - helps me in creating a model file
- php artisan make: controller - helps me in creating a controller file

PHP Artisan commands make developers' tasks easier by allowing them to execute various actions using the terminal. There are more commands available aside from the ones listed above. These were the key things I encountered and learned on my third day at the company.

### Day IV
Activities:
- Modifying the visual of the basic task list

On the last day of my third week at the company, we focused on utilizing controllers and routes in our work. Our task for the day was to add additional features that were not included in the basic task list tutorial, and modify its visual appearance to make it unique. To achieve this, I utilized CSS to enhance the visual design of the task list. Bootstrap CSS was also introduced as an option in some cases. Throughout the day, we worked on modifying the basic task list using Laravel."

## Summary
Throughout that week, I learned about the importance of using the terminal in my work. It makes tasks more organized and easier to complete. Additionally, I discovered that Laravel is one of the best tools for creating websites. Its installation requires PHP and Composer, which should be present on your local machine. These were some of the key takeaways from my third week at the company.
