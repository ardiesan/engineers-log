The second day of my internship I arrived late because I had to handle my enrollment concern. I arrived to this office right on the time I said I should be arriving. Anyway, I was tasked to watch a video on effective communication and it turned out to be a recording of a presentation by Sir Raymond in google meet, a year ago. It was very informative and insightful and has made me more aware/conscious not only in the work environment but also in my daily life. Here below are my insights and understanding on what it means to be an effective communicator. At the 2nd half of the day me and my fellow colleagues were shown on how ticketing in jira works and also how to give estimates on our task and subtasks.

# What is communication?
To put it in the simplest terms, it is the transfer of information. It involves a sender and receiver, and the reciever could also send one back.

#### Communication mediums
Communication mediums, channels, or avenues. This how and where the information travels before going to the receiver. For example, if you are talking to a person in front of you, the words that come out from your mouth would travel through the air before reaching the ears of the person you are talking to. I will talk about the different ways that people use when talking to one another.

**Face-to-Face**
With F2F(face-to-face), the person you are to talking to is right in front of you and you can get immediate feedback from the person you are talking to. Their thoughts and feelings are perceivable. And its easier to have engagements with one another.

**Calls**
With calls, the factor of being right in front of the person is removed. There is the option of having a video call, but its not the same as having the person right in front of you. 

**Chat/Direct Messaging**
With Chatting/Direct Messaging(DM), you may get the instant feedback just like F2F because there we all have our mobile devices with us and also that we are connected most of the time. Though it may be more difficult to address sensitive issues for some.

**Email**
With email, its more formal than chatting/dming. It can be good with making announcements or giving information. But it is not effective for back and forth discussions because it is much more difficult to back track on previous discussions due to how the emails are structures.

In my experience so far, I can agree with the definitions of each avenue above. However I would like to give my opinion on DMs, it mentioned that it may be difficult to address sensitive issues. For me, out of all the 4 avenues, I find chatting the most effective way. This is because of personality & demeanor, if ever there are arguments, I tend to trip on my tongue and lose my train of thought. With typing in chat, it gives me time to collect my thoughts and carefully type and read what I wrote. It also goes vice-versa because there is less chance to be interrupted and actually be heard.

What I find the most difficult is to communicate through email. I find it difficult because of the way I have to change the way I talk because of how formal an email should be. I end up taking more time finding the appropriate words to sound formal.

#### Mistakes in Communication
There are many mistakes and problems in communication, may it be due to personality, or maybe it is from a lack of awareness, or lack of social skills.

#### How to be an Effective Communicator
It is important to be good at communicating, this is not only so that information can correctly be passed but also cultivate a harmonious environment in the workspace that promotes growth.

It be an effective communicator it is important to:
- **Be Prepared** - You have to prepare what you are talking about, if you don't understand what you're saying. Then it is likely that the person you are talking to does not understand either
- **Be Visual** - Give cues, make guides, show examples of what you are talking about, so that you and the people you talk to are on the same page
- **Be Mindful** - Understand the people you are talking to, they may not be on the same level as you, maybe they come from a different background and they wont pick up the same context that you're seeing. It is your job as an effective communicator to make adjustments.
- **Be Taking Notes** - A good communicator is also a good listener. Effective communication also lies in how well you understand what is being said and then condensing it and only picking up the vitals parts.
- **Be Polite** - Even if someone is right, would you really appreciate and be thankful if they were rude to you and talking in a condenscending manner? It really comes a long way if you treat the person you are talking to with respect. They will appreciate it and, in return, treat you with respect you.
