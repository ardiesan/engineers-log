The continual growth of web development. Web development began with the creation of the World Wide Web in March 1989. The small beginning of web development started as a hypertext project, also called by its creators "WorldWideWeb," which means a "web" of hypertext documents that can be viewed using local browsers.

In web development, new things are being added and improved for a faster and smoother way of communicating and collaborating on ideas and projects.

## What is a "dynamic" website?
Dynamic websites are the type of website that automatically chooses the material displayed each time a person visits it. This display varies based on a variety of parameters, such as viewer demographics, time of day, location, language preferences, and so on. Dynamic websites provide viewers with unique material each time they visit the site. This is accomplished by combining client-side and server-side scripting.


###  client-side and server-side scripting? say what?
**Client-Side Scripting:** This code is performed by the viewer's browser and is written in scripting languages such as JavaScript. It is responsible for producing modifications to the webpage in response to user inputs such as mouse clicks or keyboard input usage.

**Server-side scripting:** on the other hand, refers to code that is run by the server before the content is sent to the viewer's browser. When a webpage is loaded or visited, this impacts it, such as with login pages, submission forms, and shopping carts.

By utilizing both scripting methods, modern websites can adapt to each user's view of the page while decreasing server load time.

### Elements of dynamic websites

Originally, websites were basically just static HTML pages. However, as time passed, users began to expect better performance, and developers wanted intuitive workflows which erected dynamic websites. But this does not mean that static websites are obsolete. In fact, static sites are the go-to for publishing a website that doesn't require ongoing or expensive hosting. It is popular among small businesses, bloggers, content creators, etc.

## Basic requirements for a dynamic website

How do you create a dynamic website? These are some basic requirements you need to understand before you approach custom website builders for your website.
- **Web Server** - You will need a web browser to use the internet, as well as an operating system and a computer to browse the web.
- **Database** -  A database is an information house where data is stored in different tables that can be retrieved whenever the need arises. Dynamic websites pull data from the database and file system with the help of server-side scripting languages to build web pages, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- **Content Management System (CMS)** - The content management system (CMS) is the part of a web server that allows data to be accessed from the database and file system. It is written in a server-side scripting language to create a connection between the web server, database, and the client's browser.

## Static Sites
Now that we know what dynamic sites are. Let us discuss Static Sites.
Originally, websites were basically just static HTML pages. However, as time passed, users began to expect better performance, and developers wanted intuitive workflows which erected dynamic websites. But this does not mean that static websites are obsolete.

**So, what is a static site?**

A static site is a website composed of HTML files, wherein each file represents a physical page of a website. As the word "static" suggests, its code is fixed but can be updated manually. Static web pages are delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored. Thus, the same content is delivered every time the page is loaded.
