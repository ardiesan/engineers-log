Now that we know what dynamic sites are. Let us discuss **Static Sites**.

Originally, websites were basically just static HTML pages. However, as time passed, users began to expect better performance, and developers wanted intuitive workflows which erected dynamic websites. But this does not mean that static websites are obsolete. In fact, static sites are the go-to for publishing a website that doesn't require ongoing or expensive hosting. It is popular among small businesses, bloggers, content creators, etc.


## So, what is a static site?

A static site is a website composed of HTML files, wherein each file represents a physical page of a website. As the word "static" suggests, its code is fixed but can be updated manually. Static web pages are delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored. Thus, the same content is delivered every time the page is loaded.

As shown in the illustration above, static web pages are passed straight from the web server to the user's browser. On the other, with dynamic web pages, the server processes scripting language, query database, and other functions then finally pass the result to the browser. With these steps gone, static sites are extremely fast and easy to maintain.
