Websites can be classified as either static or dynamic. Static websites, which are often made entirely of HTML, are fixed and show the same content to every user. A dynamic website, on the other hand, uses advanced programming and databases in addition to HTML to display different material and allow user interaction. As you can see, creating static websites is simpler than creating dynamic ones. However, this does not mean that static sites are better than dynamic sites (vice versa).

**DISADVANTAGES**

  As mentioned, dynamic websites offers better user experience compared to static websites. Web pages are generated as per user's input which exerts a major toll on server resources. As a result, the server has bottlenecks, and end users have delayed response times.


- _Costly_

  Compared to creating a static website, creating a dynamic website might be more difficult.
  As a result, developing a dynamic website will be more expensive and need significant resources to develop and maintain.
