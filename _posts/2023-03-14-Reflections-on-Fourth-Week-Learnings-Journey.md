In the fourth week of my internship with the company, I made progress in my understanding of how to make a basic task list in the Laravel team, how to follow the instructions to make it, and how to enhance and apply some adjustments. I learned a lot this week, and I was eager to learn more about using Laravel.

## Presenting the Basic Task List with Bootstrap - Day 13

In the morning, we presented our basic task list creation with the improved design. On my Basic Task List, I learned about how to use bootstrap when designing my tables and buttons. I added some features, such as creating a new task, reading the list of tasks, updating the list of tasks by changing some information in the task, and deleting the list of tasks. Despite the fact that I was late, I'm glad our mentor understands and gives me enough time to finish my task. After the presentation, we do a half-day because of the transportation strike.

### Using git rm - Day 14

After improving my Basic Task List, we were instructed to delete the contents we created and learn how to use git rm. I learned that if I delete some files, I should use the CLI terminal to ensure that they are completely removed. I'm having a hard time this day because we do the work from home due to the transportation strike, and it was new to me to use a Windows computer, and it needs to download Ubuntu when using Docker in Windows. So it takes a lot of time for me to finally set up my Laravel. After that, I understood and followed the instructions to view the output of the Laravel Team's Basic Task List, so it was nice to see the code turn out well, even if it was 8 years ago.

### Using git diff and Concept of Laravel Middleware - Day 15

On this day, we were assigned the task of understanding the function of git diff and comparing the contents of co-interns. Following that, I learned about the concept of Laravel Middleware, and we were assigned a task to create a login page, which I failed to complete. I'm having difficulty tracing and correcting the errors. After trying, I learned how to fix the errors, and it was such a challenging task for me.

### Using git revert - Day 16

On this day, we were assigned the task of updating our reflection from the third week and responding to all of the comments that had been left on it. I edited and updated it, but it didn't turn out well due to my faulty process. I have so many corrections about the acronyms, consistency of bold cases, and statements that are incoherent, so I try more to understand and improve my corrections.

### Git Commands

Here's the list of Git commands we used this week.

- **git rm** - `git rm <file name>`
- **git diff** - `git diff branch-1, branch-2`
- **git revert** - `git revert <commit hash>`
- **git log** - `command to shows commit history`
- **git push** - `command to update the remote repository with the reverted changes`

Lastly, I'm having a hard time catching up on my learning this week, but I'll work hard to understand more.
