## Day 1: Understanding Static and Dynamic Sites

On the first day of the 18th week of my internship, I researched static and dynamic websites and the differences between them.

### Static Sites
- **What are They?** Static sites have fixed content that remains unchanged until manually edited. They're simple, fast, and secure, but may require technical skills for content updates.
- **Example:** This very blog you're reading is a static site powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

### Dynamic Sites
- **What are They?** Dynamic sites change content based on user interactions and database updates. They're interactive and flexible but might be slower and more complex to maintain.

### Advantages
- **Static Sites:** Quick loading, fewer security vulnerabilities, and easier hosting and setup.
- **Dynamic Sites:** Interactivity, personalized content, and more straightforward content management.

### Common Static Site Generators
1. **Jekyll:** A widely used generator that turns text into static websites, suitable for blogs or simple sites.
2. **Hugo:** Known for its speed, Hugo creates websites rapidly, ideal for blogs or portfolios.
3. **Gatsby:** It combines React and GraphQL, often used for web apps, pulling dynamic data into static sites.

### Speed Difference
I learned about the speed differences between static and dynamically generated pages. Some pages are better delivered statically, while others are best generated dynamically, either from the server or the client side.

- **Server-Side Pages:** Utilize server-side scripts like PHP.
- **Client-Side Pages:** Managed by JavaScript, including pages using AJAX or React.js for DOM manipulation.
