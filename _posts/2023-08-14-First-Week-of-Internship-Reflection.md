## 1st Week Reflection:

### Day 1: Reflection about Cathedral and the Bazaar, How to Reports Bugs Effectively

I learned about the advantages of the Bazaar Model, which allows for faster development, quicker bug fixing, and a more adaptable software product. This is due to the power of community-driven collaboration. After reading the article, I can see why it has been a manifesto for the open-source movement.

By reading some article about *How to Report Bugs Effectively*, It is crucial for the smooth development and improvement of the software. When encountering such bugs in software, taking the necessary steps to report them effectively is essential. This helps developers understand and fix the issue and improves overall software.

### Day 2: My First Pull Request & Effective Communication

After making my first reflection via markdown file, I feel great for finally submitting my first pull request. It was definitely a learning experience since it was my first time using a markdown, and I feel accomplished for contributing to our company's engineer's log. Also my mentor instructed me to watch a video about Effective Communication and make a reflection about it.

Effective Communication is essential in all aspects of life. Whether in personal relationships, at work, or in any other setting, communicating effectively is crucial for success. It's not just about being able to express your thoughts and ideas but also about actively listening to others and understanding their perspectives. Reflecting on our communication skills can help us identify areas we may need to improve, such as being clearer and concise, active listening, or being more understanding. I also find that being prepared helps build confidence such as the way we speak, and avoiding assumptions is also an important practice in communication as it prevents misunderstandings.

### Day 3: Docker and MySQL Workbench

Today, my mentor instructed us to install Docker and MySQL Workbench using home-brew and allowed us to explore and study more about it. At the end of the day, I was able to connect both of them, and I felt satisfied.

### Day 4: Laravel Sail

Today is my first day getting in touch with Laravel Sail. At first, it was confusing, but as I continued exploring its features, I started to understand how it works. I was able to migrate some tables for testing and did some test queries using MySQL CLI commands in docker. I'm looking forward to learn more about it.

Overall, looking back on the first week, it was an enlightening experience. I gained a lot of insights into how I can improve both my skills and my mental outlook. I'm definitely going to hold onto this experience and work on continuing to develop myself.
