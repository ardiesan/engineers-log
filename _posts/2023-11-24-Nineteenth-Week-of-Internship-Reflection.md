Throughout my 19th week of internship, I focused on refining my skills and applying new knowledge. I explored GitHub workflows for my Jekyll project and learned the significance of understanding various tools. Additionally, valuable tips on CI/CD practices and the use of Git tagging were shared by our mentor. The week encapsulated a mix of hands-on learning and practical insights, contributing to my growth in the internship journey.

## GitHub Workflow for Jekyll Project 

On the first day of my 19th-week internship, my job was to publish my Jekyll project on GitHub Pages. I tinkered with my project, changed some things, and added a few articles. Then, I made a repository for my project on GitHub and checked out the "Actions" tab.  
  
GitHub had my back with suggested workflows for my Jekyll project. Instead of figuring out my workflow, I went with what GitHub recommended. It's like having a smart helper, GitHub can see what kind of project you have and suggest the right workflows. The big lesson here is that it's cool to use what smart people have already made. Why make something from scratch if there's a good solution already?  
  
I thought about making my workflow, but I got a bit lost. That's when the GitHub-suggested one saved the day. I added it to my project, gave it a test run, and voila! My Jekyll project was up and running on GitHub Pages. Now, I can show it off to the world. Even though it's a simple site, I'll keep updating it with my articles.  
  
The main lesson from today is that it's okay to rely on what's already there. My chosen workflow, just one file, did all the hard work to get my Jekyll project on GitHub Pages. It's like borrowing a cool tool instead of making one from scratch. Simple can be super smart!

## Smart Tips from the Mentor 

On day two of my 19th-week internship, our mentor dropped some helpful knowledge bombs during our team meeting. We discussed topics like cloud services, home servers, and the functionalities of Termux. A key takeaway emerged, it's crucial not to solely depend on sophisticated cloud services, gaining an understanding of the internal workings is equally important. Our mentor also introduced the concept of building home servers from spare PCs. This idea intrigued me, and I'm keen to explore it further, seeing it as an opportunity to learn how to set up a server. Lastly, the mentor introduced some advanced uses of Termux, including turning it into a DIY SMS server with two-factor authentication.  
  
After our meeting, I got down to my task, working on my Jekyll project. I sent the links for both my Jekyll and Laravel projects to the mentor to check out the workflows and verify that it is working on the GitHub Actions tab. He gave a thumbs up but had some smart suggestions. Things like keeping file paths and deployment directories secret on GitHub, plus making the source branch a variable in my repository for flexibility. These tweaks make sure my workflows not only work well but also stay private and secure. A great lesson in making things secure and flexible!

## Learning and Refining Practices

Day three of my 19th-week internship was a straightforward one. I continued working on my Jekyll project, reading the official Jekyll documentation. The insights gained were substantial, highlighting the greatness of static sites. In our daily meeting on day four, the mentor showered us interns with a set of suggestions revolving around CI/CD. The emphasis was on leveraging CI/CD mechanisms for secure storage of secrets and variables. Crucially, we were advised to not utilize hardcoded file paths or variables in YAML workflow files, urging the use of variables and secrets within GitHub for security and flexibility, a fundamental tip. Our mentor introduced us to the concept of tagging in Git. Though my approach of pulling from a branch was familiar, I learned that many projects opt for tagging instead during deployment. This was a lightbulb moment, and the mentor revealed that some still follow my approach which is to pull from a particular branch like "production" or "prod". Intrigued, I explored tagging, finding it surprisingly simple. Now, I'm keen on implementing tagging in my Laravel workflow, a strategy I hadn't considered before. Another gem of knowledge dropped by the mentor!

## To wrap things up
Week 19 was about hands-on experiences, from deploying Jekyll projects to understanding different tools. Insights on CI/CD and Git tagging added depth to my skill set. A well-rounded week of learning and practical application in the internship journey.
