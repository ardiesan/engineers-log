## My Idea about Web Application Development
Before the internship, I do not have any idea about web application development. I already heard about it but I do not know the process done in creating web applications. During the internship, I slowly understand its processes like the tools to be utilized and the practice done in making a project. I also know that it is not easy as it is. I require practice, time, and effort to create a real working project. Those are the things that I know about web application development as of now.

## My Skills about Web Application Development Before the Internship
Computer Engineering is a course program that focuses more on hardware than software. It is not an excuse because we have some software-related courses too. Before the internship, I am not fond of coding but I love discovering things and making stuff out of them. One of them is creating websites. It is not something that I used to but it gives me interest especially when I manage to create one out from scratch. Out of the learnings and skills I have before the internship, I know that it was not enough to create a web application. I know that I only have a few learnings about the web application, and that was not enough to create one. Right now, those are the things that I realized about my knowledge and skills in web application before I take my internship at the company.

## The Skills that I Attained During the Internship
During the internship, lots of things happened and It comes along with the learnings that I have learned about web application development. Web app development process, business ethics, good practices, and soft and hard skills let me realize the gaps that I need to fulfill to succeed in web app development or anything you want. In web app development, I have learned the essence of utilizing a terminal in creating and deleting files or projects. Doing things using a command is also part of it. Additionally, business ethics and good practices always come along. Business ethics such as checking notifications, acknowledging messages, and setting time to check emails are just some of the things that we must take into account when working, studying, or anything. I also learned the importance of balancing hard and soft skills. Soft skill is one of the most important aspects that every working individual must consider. It comes along with time management, adaptability to change, and more are some it. On the development side, I also learned about Laravel together with its corresponding parts like controller, routes, middleware, and more, and I also learn how to properly create a Laravel project. Those are the learnings that I have gained during the internship.

## My Skills in Writing Web Application During the Internship
As of now, setting up the local machine and creating a new project is easy to be done. After several weeks of my internship at the company, I can not truly assure you that I can write a web application as perfect as it is but I know I can make one. I can not assure you that I can make a perfect one cause I know that my skills was not enough as of now. Studying web application development requires time and efforts. I know that I am not confident as of now but I can assure that I can make one as time passed by.

## Conclusion
Taking an internship at the company is one of the biggest opportunities that I had experienced. It let me experience the actual working process and feel its environment. Making mistakes and learning from them is one of the things that I always do during my internship at the company. Those are the things that I have realized, learned, and experienced while taking my internship at the company.
