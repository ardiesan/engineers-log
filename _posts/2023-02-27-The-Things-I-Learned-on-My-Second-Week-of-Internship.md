2nd week started, and a lot happened. This week was surely a dive into a pool full of ice. 

## VSCode Terminal - Day 5

On the fifth day, we made a markdown file on the reflection we did about last week, made an article about it, and pushed it to GitHub using the VSCode terminal. It was a fun day since it was my first time pushing to Github using a terminal I managed to push and pull files from the repository because usually I just drag the files directly to GitHub. 

## Introduction to Laravel and MySQL Workbench - Day 6

The sixth day was about Laravel. I learned that Laravel is a Php framework that follows the MVC layout, and we were briefly introduced to the MySQL workbench. And this day sir then expounded my knowledge about what MVC is. 

## Docker Image and Business Ethics - Day 7

The seventh day was a rough day. In Slack sir tasked us to download an image from a docker, run it and connect the docker image to the Mysql workbench. But we made a lot of mistakes this day. We didn't acknowledge sir's instructions in Slack and we used the conference room without permission. Sir was frustrated but he was still calm and used nice words, and I greatly appreciate it. Though many downs this day was surely an interesting day.

## MySQL Workbench Utilization - Day 8

Eigth day started, and the day was fun. Using the MySQL Workbench we made tables, insert data, delete data, add foreign keys, and delete tables. And since this day was a holiday for the Japanese, only we the interns and sir are in the office, I also realized how big the office was when there are not a lot of people around. Near the end of our shift, sir bought us shakoy, and in the pantry, we talked and laughed and sir shared good memories. It was a moment I'll never forget, it was a warm day.
