In my week of the internship, I encountered new challenges and valuable insights. I learned the importance of clear communication, precise updates, and seeking clarification before starting tasks.. Here's a brief reflection on my week's experiences.

## Day 1: Basic Note Taking App using Laravel

My task was to create a simple note-taking app using Laravel. I set up Laravel on my computer and made an app with add, view, update, and delete features, connecting it to MySQL in a Docker container. Unfortunately, I didn't finish the app due to a task-blocker. At first, I thought it was because the Bootstrap styles didn't apply to my app. Since time was limited, I decided to address this issue the next day. This day, I worked on my own and I realized the importance of being able to work with minimal supervision because managers and seniors could be busy with their responsibilities, so being independent is valuable to make progress on a tasks. Since I'm new to Laravel, I learned that I should make sure to read and understand everything carefully to complete a task.

## Day 2: Importance of Clear Communication and Seeking Clarification

Today, I discovered that I mistakenly mentioned the wrong blocker in my previous update. It wasn't Bootstrap, but Tailwind that caused the issue. I learned that it is very important to provide updates with clarity and specificity, avoiding fancy terms that may lead to misunderstandings. If I make an error in my communication, it is crucial to correct it right away to prevent any uncertainties. Moreover, I realized the significance of clarifying expectations with my seniors before starting a task like the note-taking app. Identifying specifications and problems to solve beforehand helps me perform the task smoothly. Lastly, during a conversation with the manager and engineers, I learned that there's no one-size-fits-all programming language. Each language has its strengths depending on the use case. As a developer, being versatile, adaptable, and constantly learning is essential to excel in this field.

## Day 3: Model View Controller (MVC)

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it's a way of organizing our code in software development. The Model holds the core business logic, while the View is responsible for how things look to users, and the Controller handles user input and updates the Model or View accordingly. Today, I learned about MVC (Model-View-Controller) and why it's essential in software development. I used to think all the business logic goes in controllers, but my manager clarified that models should hold the core business logic for better maintenance and reusability. By having functions in the models, controllers can easily call them, and when updates are needed, developers only need to modify the model function, not each function in the controller. If updates or changes are required, they only need to modify the model functions, reducing the risk of introducing errors in multiple places. This approach also improves the overall structure and organization of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain in the long run. This insight will help me structure my code better in the future.

## Day 4: Exploring Laravel and Building Bonds

Today is the fourth day of my second week of internship, and I focused on working on my note-taking app using Laravel. Since I'm new to Laravel, I spent time reading its documentation to become more familiar with its features.

One delightful moment was when the manager took me to lunch. It was a wonderful opportunity to connect and build a friendly relationship with the team. The lunch outing made me feel welcomed and valued as part of the team.

I'm eager to continue my journey with Laravel, as I find it exciting to explore its possibilities. I look forward to learning more for me to be able to contribute to upcoming projects. With each day, I'm becoming more confident in my abilities and excited to see the progress of my Note Taking Application.
