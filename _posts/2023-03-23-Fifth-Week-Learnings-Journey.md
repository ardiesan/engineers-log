In this fifth week, I have acquired new knowledge in Git Commands, jQuery in Modal Dialog, learnings in Web Development, and the workshop with the title Soft Skills Workshop. I was so happy with the activity prepared by our mentor; it left me energized, ready to brainstorm, and able to properly execute the given activity.

## Soft Skills Workshop and Git Commands - Day 17

On this day, it was the first time for me to hear about soft skills, and I learned that being able to perform them has a good impact on career success. In addition to that, I learned that I should adapt to a change by gaining more knowledge and being able to fit the current changes that are happening in the industry and the real-life experience that happens now. When our mentor wanted us to watch the movie Who Moved My Cheese, it taught me a lot of things, including that I should focus on my goals, face my fears, don't limit myself when it comes to learning, don't lose sight of my vision, and don't give up. It teaches me many life lessons, including how to prepare for change, adapt quickly to it, enjoy the change, and be ready to adapt quickly and enjoy it again.

### jQuery in Modal Dialog - Day 18

On this day, we will be given a task to utilize jQuery to put the form inside a Modal Dialog, so I wasn't able to finish the task because I was focusing on my problem with authentication, which is not the right thing to do on this day, and I should only focus on the task given so that I was able to understand it and accomplish the task easily. After that, our mentor helped us a lot on how to deal with and understand the tutorial in jQuery, and I learned that when making a Modal Dialog in my Task, the expected result is that I can use the button to appear the form, the form should function well, and I can see the data; after the form is submitted, the Modal Dialog should be closed. I was able to understand this with the help of our mentor.

### Web Development - Day 19

On this day, we were given a task to create an article or reflection about web development. In this internship, I gained a lot of knowledge in web development, including the process of starting from scratch to create an application using the front and back ends. I'm focusing now on my learnings on the front end, which are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. In my journey, I don't have any skills, and I'll try my best to improve and be able to understand web development when making applications.

### Authentication and Protect Your Githubs - Day 20
On this day, we were given a task to fix the authentication, and I'm having a problem because my logout is not functioning, and after so much time, I realized that the code I was using in bootstrap is not compatible with my current code or the bootstrap link is expired, so after that, I changed the code, and it turned out well, as did my authentication. Furthermore, in order to understand my task by accessing the task creation page, I must first sign in; if I access the task without first signing in, it will redirect to the login page. So in the afternoon, we followed the instructions given on our mentor's site, which were to "Protect Your Githubs," and with the help of our mentor, I was able to execute the following instructions and see the expected results.

Here are the Git Commands and Soft Skills  I learned during this week.
- **git reset** - `git reset --hard HEAD~5`
- **git restore** - `git restore <namefile>`
- **Adapting to Change** - `able to adapt changes in work and in real life.`
- **Problem Solving** - `able to analyze and fix the problem easily.`
- **Time Management** - `able to manage the task on time.`
- **Professional Attitude** - `communicating with others to resolve problems and showing respect for all team members and mentors.`

Lastly, this week was a nice experience, and I gained a lot of knowledge from our mentors. I'll always remember my learnings in soft skills and apply them, willing to adapt to changes and focus on the goals with more learnings.
