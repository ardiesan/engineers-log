An internship is a program offered by a company or organization that allows someone to gain experience in their chosen field of work. It provides an opportunity to visualize the actual setup and environment and participate in various trainings to experience their chosen field of work. The goal of an internship is to help someone learn and develop new skills, gain professional experience, explore and discover different career paths, and decide on their future career path based on their field of study.

## My First Week in the Company
---
### DAY I
- Introduction

Change is constant, and adopting is necessary to move forward. As an intern at the company, I learned from our mentor, Sir Raymound, about the importance of discipline and time management. Being able to complete tasks responsibly requires discipline. Additionally, I realized the importance of prioritizing personal health. Working in poor physical condition can lead to deterioration of our health, and can also put our colleagues at risk. Taking care of ourselves is just as important as taking care of our co-workers.

### DAY II
Article:
- How to ask for help in a Smarter Way
- Cathedral and the Bazaar

After reading the articles, I learned the importance of solving a problem before asking for help. It is crucial to attempt to find a solution first before making any statements. When asking for help, it's important to state the problem, the diagnostics, and the solutions used in fixing it in a specific, informative, and precise manner. This can help to effectively convey the issue and make it easier for the person providing help to understand. In contrast, Cathedral is a closed modality used to develop software locally or by a select group of people. On the other hand, bazaar is the opposite of Cathedral, as it's an open modality used to develop software globally or openly.

### DAY III
Article:
- How to report a Bug Effectively
- Effective Communication

When reporting a bug, it's important to note that poorly written reports often receive less attention and negative feedback. To avoid this, it's crucial to create a thorough and proper report. Additionally, it's recommended to bring supporting materials to prove the existence of the bug before making a report. Effective communication involves not only being a good speaker but also being an attentive listener. It's important to note that differences between individuals can create gaps in communication. Therefore, it's essential to be confident when speaking, control the volume of our voices, avoid making assumptions, and take other measures to improve the effectiveness of communication.

### DAY IV
Article:
- Git and Github
- Semantic HTML

Git and GitHub are distinct concepts, although they share some similarities. GitHub is an online platform that is built on Git and provides features such as sharing, modifying, adding, and deleting repositories easily. In addition, it is important to develop semantic HTML, as it allows code to be organized in a way that can be understood by other developers. Semantics provide meaning to the code, and promoting the use of sign language can make code more readable and meaningful for everyone.

## SUMMARY

My first week at the company was kind of tiring, but also fun. There were some adjustments to be made, but I enjoyed expanding my knowledge about software development. Applying the lessons and ideas we learned from reading the articles is the best practice that we can use in the actual field or on a daily basis. These are the things that I learned after my first week at the company.
