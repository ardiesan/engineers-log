Over the past two days, I've been actively refining my Jekyll project. On Day 1, I focused on enhancing its appearance and experimenting with new features, considering the possibility of sharing it widely by deploying it on the Ronins server. Despite encountering some challenges, the learning process in web development remained enjoyable.

## Sixteenth Week Reflection:

### Day 1: Exploring and Customizing My Jekyll Project

Today, I continued working on my Jekyll project, making it look better and trying out new features. I'm thinking of putting it on the Ronins server to share it more widely. It's been fun tweaking the details, and even though it's a bit challenging, each step helps me learn more about web development.

### Day 2:  Deploying My Jekyll Project to the Ronins Server

Today, I successfully deployed my Jekyll project to the Ronins server using rsync. It can be accessed via the following URL: jwapano.ronins.site/jade-blog. I encountered some challenges during the process, particularly in configuring my shell script file. However, in the end, I was able to overcome these hurdles, and I'm very pleased with the result.
